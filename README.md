# basic-data-structures
This is basically to get an hold of coding by implementing data structure C.
It includes several *sorting algorithms, stacks, queues, linked lists* and other basic fundamental programs.

## Software to use
Source code editor: VS code along with mingw (suggestion)

To `install` and `set up` VS code for C and C++ programing environment, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xCskNFVt2c&t=725s) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBb0Z0e8szw)

## How to use?
1. [Download](https://github.com/AnkitaTandon/basic-data-structures/tree/master/src) the file of the topic you wish to experiment with.
2. `Compile` and `Run` the file.
3. Enter the data as asked to learn the outcome.

## holds

#### Sorting algorithm: It is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements using comparison operator.
- Bubble sort
- Quick sort
- Shell sort
- Insertion sort

#### Stack: It is a container of objects that are inserted and deleted according to last-in-first-out (LIFO)
- Stack Operations
- Infix to Postfix (eg: a+b to ab+)
- Evaluating Postfix (eg: a=5,b=4 then ab+ is 9)

#### Queue: It is a container of objects that are inserted and deleted according to first-in-first-out (FIFO)
- Queue Operations
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue (in process)

#### Linked List: It is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, hence the elements aren't stored at contiguously.
                  Each node of a list is made up of two items - the data and a reference (pointer) to the next node. The last node has a reference to null.
- Linked List Operations
- Circular Linked List
- Reverse Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

**Random**
- Fibonicci series
- Sparse and transpose matrix
- Digit count
